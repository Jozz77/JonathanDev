        I am one of the members of a scientific club that brings together
        enthusiasts of the Internet and new technologies. At ITberries, we
        design and develop websites and web applications. Apart from the
        projects, our biggest undertaking is the Ciemna Strona UX conference,
        which we are organizing for the sixth time. Working in a club as a
        Front-End Developer definitely developed my skills in group work and
        working under time pressure. If you want to know more about us, click
